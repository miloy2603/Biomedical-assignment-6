\end{center}

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a dramatic loss of human life worldwide and presents an unprecedented challenge to public health, food systems and the world of work. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating: tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty, while the number of undernourished people, currently estimated at nearly 690 million, could increase by up to 132 million by the end of the year.\par

Millions of enterprises face an existential threat. Nearly half of the worldâ€™s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food.\par

Biomedical engineers made many innovations which saved lives of many people.\par
\begin{center}
  \small{\textbf{MASKS }}
\end{center}

Masking is a critical public health tool for preventing spread of covid-19 and it is important to remember that any mask is better than no mask. To protect yourself and others from covid-19 , it is recommended  that wear the most protective mask that fits well and can be worn consistently. It protect us from the virus from entering in respiratory system.\par 

\begin{center}
  \small{\textbf{VACCINATION }}
\end{center}

Vaccination is the most powerful weapon against the Coronavirus. Vaccines stimulates our immune system to fight against the virus upon entering our bodies. It is injected in our body where it is used to make anti-bodies for a particular virus. So it is recommended for compulsorily have their vaccination done on time.\par

\begin{center}
  \small{\textbf{RAPID ACTION PPE KITS}}
\end{center}

PPE kits are amde by very fine cloth with very small pores which does  not allow thw bigger coronavirus to pass through it.  They are very helpful for those doctors who went very close to covid-19  patient. it saved lives of many doctors who were to treat covid-19 patients.\par
 
\begin{center}
  \small{\textbf{3-D FACE SHIELD}}
\end{center}

Face shield is very useful for everyone. From doctor to patients , it has helped to check the spreading of virus through fluids which came to air due to sneezing and hence improving the life of masks.\par

Thus biomedical engineers are pioneers for us and hidden heroes during this covid-19 pandemic.
